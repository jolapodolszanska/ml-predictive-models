## Introduction 

Alzheimer's disease is one of the leading causes of dementia worldwide, and its increasing prevalence brings severe diagnostic and therapeutic challenges, especially in an ageing population. Current diagnostic methods, which include patient histories, neuropsychological tests and MRI images, often fail to achieve sufficient sensitivity and specificity. In response to these challenges, this research presents an advanced convolutional neural network (CNN) model, combining ResNet50 and Inception v3 architectures, to accurately classify the stages of Alzheimer's disease based on MRI images. The model was developed and tested using data from the Alzheimer's Disease Neuroimaging Initiative (ADNI). It classifies MRI images into four clinical categories of disease severity. The model's evaluation results, based on metrics such as precision, sensitivity and the F1 measure, confirm its effectiveness. Additional augmentation techniques and differential weights for the classes helped improve the model's accuracy. Visualization of the results using the t-SNE method and confusion matrix further illustrates the model's ability to differentiate disease categories, which can support neurological diagnosis in detecting and classifying Alzheimer's disease.

## Future work
Research could benefit from the exploration and implementation of other advanced neural network architectures, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) and Capsule Networks, which may offer new perspectives and improved accuracy in the diagnosis of Alzheimer's disease. Further work could focus on increasing the interpretability of deep learning models, which is crucial in a medical context so that physicians can better understand the decisions made by the model. Future research should also include extensive clinical validations that could confirm the effectiveness of the models in real medical environments, which is necessary for their practical application
